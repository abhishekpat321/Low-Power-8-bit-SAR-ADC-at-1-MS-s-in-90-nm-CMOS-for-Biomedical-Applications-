## üß† Abstract

Implantable and wearable biomedical devices depend heavily on accurate and energy-efficient signal acquisition. The **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** is a key component in such systems, converting analog physiological signals into digital form for further processing. However, ADCs are often among the most power-hungry blocks in medical SoCs. To address this challenge, this project proposes a **low-power, single-ended 8-bit Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC**, operating at a sampling rate of **1 MS/s** using a **90 nm CMOS process** and a **1.2 V supply voltage**.

The design employs four key functional blocks ‚Äî **Sample & Hold circuit**, **Capacitive DAC**, **Dynamic Comparator**, and **SAR Logic** ‚Äî optimized for low power and high accuracy. The **bootstrapped switch** in the Sample & Hold stage minimizes distortion and maintains constant on-resistance. The **dynamic comparator** eliminates static power consumption, operating only during clock transitions. The **binary-weighted Capacitive DAC** performs charge redistribution with good linearity, while the **SAR Logic** (based on D flip-flops) implements the binary search algorithm efficiently.

The complete schematic is designed and simulated using **Cadence Virtuoso (Spectre)** tools. The 90 nm CMOS technology node enables reduced voltage operation, smaller device sizes, and improved energy efficiency. Simulation results confirm that the proposed architecture achieves **low power consumption**, **fast decision-making**, and **high sampling accuracy**, meeting the requirements of **portable and implantable biomedical systems**.

This project contributes to sustainable and energy-efficient medical electronics design, supporting the **United Nations SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)** and **SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)** by enabling compact, battery-powered diagnostic systems that enhance accessibility in healthcare technology.
